# code_editor
this is just a glimpse of what me and my team will be making to develop our knowledge and use it for competitions in future 
my part is to make it as user friendly as i can 
things that i will add -
 1. font color for the code to not keep it just plain white
 2. enlarging a video cal tab on click ( a suggestion from friend )
 
<-- more ideas will be help full -->
